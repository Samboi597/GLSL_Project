# GLSL_Project
GLSL shading project

This is something I made for my Advanced Graphics module in the final academic year of my course.
This program takes 16 defined control-points, and uses them to create a parametric curve.
A number of polygons are drawn to define the curve, and GLSL is used to texture them.
